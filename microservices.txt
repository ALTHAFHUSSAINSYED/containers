🔹 1. Monolithic Applications (like your VProfile project)

Definition: One single large application containing all the features/services.

Example in VProfile:

Login/Authentication

Dashboard

Posts

Chat

Notifications

👉 All of these are bundled into one big .war file (artifact) deployed in one Tomcat server.

Problem:

If you update even a small feature (say Chat), you need to redeploy the whole application.

Everything must be written in one language (Java in this case).

Scaling is difficult: You can’t scale only Chat service; you must scale the whole app.

Like an “elephant”: big, heavy, and slow to move.

🔹 2. Microservices Applications

Definition: Break down the monolithic app into smaller independent services, each running on its own.

Example:

Login UI → Java service

Chat → Node.js service

Notifications → Python service

Payment → Ruby service

👉 Each one is a separate application with its own code, libraries, and runtime.

How they communicate:

They talk to each other via APIs.

Requests are usually routed through an API Gateway.

Advantages:

Independent development: Teams can work in parallel.

Independent scaling: If Chat gets high traffic, only Chat service can be scaled.

Polyglot: You can use different languages for different services.

Problem:

If you don’t use containers, you’ll need separate servers for each service → very costly.

🔹 3. Why Microservices + Containers (Docker)?

Containers solve the isolation problem:

Each microservice runs in its own container (independent).

All can run on the same host without conflicts.

Cheaper than running multiple servers.

Example:

One host machine (Linux server).

Inside it → Docker runs multiple containers:

Java app container

Python app container

Node.js app container

👉 That’s why in DevOps world, whenever we say microservices, we almost always talk about Docker/Kubernetes as well.

🔹 4. Real-world Example: Amazon

Amazon has hundreds of microservices:

Login → one service

Cart → another service

Payment → another service

Recommendations → another service

Each one runs independently, can scale separately, and can be built in different languages.

🔹 5. DevOps Perspective

As a DevOps engineer, you don’t need to know how to write microservices in code. You need to know:

How to deploy them (Docker, Kubernetes).

How they communicate (APIs, service discovery, API Gateway).

How to scale them (Kubernetes HPA, Docker Swarm).

How to monitor/log them (Grafana, ELK, Prometheus).

✅ Interview-ready Answer:

“In monolithic architecture, all features are packed into one big application. Any small change requires redeployment of the whole app, and scaling is at the application level. Microservices split the application into small independent services, each running separately and communicating via APIs. This allows independent development, scaling, and even different programming languages. But managing multiple microservices on different servers would be costly, so we containerize them with Docker. Containers provide isolation and allow us to run multiple microservices on the same host efficiently. In production, we usually orchestrate them with Kubernetes for scalability and reliability.”

🔹 Who communicates via APIs?

In microservices architecture, both happen:

User → API (via frontend)

A user uses the app (web/mobile).

The frontend (like React, Angular, or even Nginx serving UI) sends API requests to backend microservices.

Example:

User clicks “Login” → frontend sends API request POST /login → goes to Auth microservice.

Service → Service (internal APIs)

Microservices themselves talk to each other via APIs inside Docker network (or Kubernetes cluster).

Example:

Orders service needs user info → it calls API of User service.

Payment service calls API of Orders service to confirm payment.

🔹 In Docker (your project)

Inside Docker Compose, each service has a container name (e.g., tomcat, mysql, rabbitmq).

Services use these names like hostnames. Example:

Tomcat connects to MySQL at mysql:3306.

Nginx connects to Tomcat at tomcat:8080.

This internal communication is via APIs or protocols depending on the service.

Nginx ↔ Tomcat → HTTP (API calls).

Tomcat ↔ MySQL → SQL queries (not REST APIs, but still “service-to-service communication”).

Tomcat ↔ RabbitMQ → AMQP protocol.

So in microservices:

If it’s frontend ↔ backend, it’s almost always HTTP/REST APIs.

If it’s service ↔ service, it can be HTTP APIs, gRPC, or other protocols (SQL, MQ, etc.).

✅ Interview way to say it:

“In microservices, communication happens over APIs. Users interact with the system via frontend APIs exposed by services, and services themselves talk to each other using APIs or other well-defined protocols inside the Docker network. For example, in our project Nginx communicates with Tomcat over HTTP, Tomcat connects to MySQL over SQL protocol, and RabbitMQ handles messaging.”

In your Vprofile project on Docker, Tomcat (the application layer) is the brain that interacts with MySQL (DB), Memcached (cache), and RabbitMQ (messaging). Let’s map out exactly how each communication works.

🔹 1. Tomcat ↔ MySQL (Database)

Protocol: SQL (MySQL protocol over TCP).

How: Tomcat uses JDBC driver to connect to MySQL.

Purpose: Persistent storage (users, posts, etc.).

Example flow:

User logs in → Tomcat sends SQL query (SELECT * FROM users WHERE ...) to MySQL.

🔹 2. Tomcat ↔ Memcached (Cache)

Protocol: Memcached protocol (simple key-value lookups over TCP, port 11211).

How: The Java app inside Tomcat has a Memcached client library.

Purpose: To improve performance by caching frequently used data instead of always hitting MySQL.

Example flow:

User profile is fetched → Tomcat first asks Memcached: “Do you have user123?”

If yes → Memcached returns cached data (fast).

If no → Tomcat queries MySQL, then stores the result in Memcached for future use.

🔹 3. Tomcat ↔ RabbitMQ (Message Queue)

Protocol: AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol, default port 5672).

How: Tomcat uses a RabbitMQ client library (Java client).

Purpose: Asynchronous communication / decoupling services.

Example flow:

User registers → Tomcat publishes a “new_user” message to RabbitMQ.

Other services (like Notification service) subscribe to that queue and send a welcome email/notification.

🔹 4. Nginx ↔ Tomcat

Protocol: HTTP (REST APIs).

Purpose: Nginx is the reverse proxy.

Example:

User hits http://VMIP:80/login.

Nginx forwards request to Tomcat (http://tomcat:8080/login).

✅ Putting it Together (Flow Example)

User → Nginx → Tomcat (HTTP).

Tomcat → Memcached (TCP, port 11211) → cache check.

If cache miss → Tomcat → MySQL (TCP, port 3306).

Tomcat → RabbitMQ (AMQP, port 5672) → send async tasks (like notifications).

So Tomcat is the hub:

Talks to Memcached for caching,

Talks to MySQL for data,

Talks to RabbitMQ for messaging,

Talks to Nginx via HTTP.

👉 Interview Answer (short version):

“In our project, Tomcat communicates with Memcached over the Memcached protocol to cache frequent queries, with MySQL using JDBC over port 3306 for persistence, and with RabbitMQ using AMQP for asynchronous messaging. Nginx handles incoming HTTP requests and forwards them to Tomcat. This architecture ensures performance (via caching), reliability (via queues), and modularity.”
